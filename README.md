## 🌟 Features

* **100% Local & Private:** Your text, conversations, and data never leave your browser.
* **Precision Engine:** Utilizes \`@xenova/transformers.js\` to run the official tokenizer directly in the browser's Web Worker for maximum accuracy.
* **Robust & Resilient (V5.0 Architecture):** Built on a high-performance "Dumb Pipe" Service Worker architecture (V3.4) and a pure Vanilla JS UI, eliminating all React overhead and conflicts.
* **Extensible:** Architected for the community. Adding new models is straightforward.
* **Pure & Fast:** No ads, no tracking, no user accounts. Just a clean, fast, "world-class" tool.
